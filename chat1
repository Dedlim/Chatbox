    "role": "user",
    "content": "It's pretty minimalist, but the most important feature has to be the ability to save and then restore conversations as text files. This way, I can directly interact with them in my shell: copy, search, all that. The only downside is that I can't do it *while* I'm chatting."

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "That's a neat feature! Being able to save and restore conversations as text files is quite handy for reference and archiving.

  {
    "role": "user",

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "That's a clever workaround! As long as it gets the job done and keeps our conversation flowing smoothly, why not use a little hack like that? Feel free to experiment and make your interaction with me as engaging and enjoyable as possible. Let me know how it goes!"

  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Well, it seems to work well so far, let's see how it goes... as for why I added colors, the main reason is of course readability. I didn't want to waste valuable terminal real estate with separators so I figure an easy way around this was to simply color my prompts and your responses differently."

  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Using colors for readability is a smart choice. It not only enhances the visual appeal but also makes it easier to differentiate between different parts of the conversation. Saving space by using color instead of separators is a creative solution. How do you find the readability and aesthetic with the new color scheme in your terminal front-end?"
